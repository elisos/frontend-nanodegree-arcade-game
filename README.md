## Overview

This game was created as a requirement for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. The goal is to use object-oriented programming to create classes and methods which implement the game play.

## Getting Started

### Running the Game
To run the game, download the repo and open the index.html file in your browser. Alternatively, you can play it [here][https://elisos.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/].

### Game Play
Help the chicken cross the road! Use the arrow buttons to move the chicken up, down, and side to side. Avoid the cars and get the chicken to the grass on the other side of the road.

### Browsers
The memory game works best in Chrome, works adequately in Firefox, and doesn't work in Internet Explorer.

### Libraries
This game uses a css animation library called Animate, found [here][https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/].
